Intended to be used with Arduino IDE.
Import the necessary boards. (ESP-12E for me)
Download the libaries that are defined.
Enter your Wifi data ssid and password in the corresponding constants.
Wire everything up correctly or change up the pin layout.
You should be running!

If you have no idea what all of this is, watch videos on this topic.

Update (broken for now, use default Code):
There is now alternative code available (Code-AccessPoint-Mode) which enables the esp controller to act as an wifi access point so you can enter the wifi credentials over you phone when you connect to the device and visit its IP address. This makes it so you do not have to enter your wifi credentials in the code yourself.
